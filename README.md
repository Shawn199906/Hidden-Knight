This thrilling 2D shooting game, created with Unity and C#, challenges players to navigate a randomly generated maze while facing off against a horde of enemies. Players must guide their character through the maze, avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies along the way. As the game progresses, the number of enemies on the map increases, making the challenge more intense. For every enemy defeated, players earn points that will contribute to their final score. Once players reach the end of the maze, their score will be displayed on the screen. With its engaging gameplay and challenging mechanics, this Unity and C# based shooting game is sure to keep players on the edge of their seats.

The object of this game is to reach the end of the map; the player may see some enemies on their way to the end. When the enemy touches the player, the player will lose health and have some hit effect. When the playerâ€™s health reaches 0, the game will bring the player to a page that tells you the game is over.
