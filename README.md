# Hidden-Knight
This is a 2D shooting game designed by Unity and C#, people need to control their character to escape from a random maze map. And in this map, there will also be some enemies randomly generated in this map. As the time passes, there will be more enemies on the map. Once you kill an enemy, you will earn some points. If you can reach the end of this map, your score will be shown at the page.

The object of this game is to reach the end of the map; the player may see some enemies on their way to the end. When the enemy touches the player, the player will lose health and have some hit effect. When the playerâ€™s health reaches 0, the game will bring the player to a page that tells you the game is over.
